In typical routing, separate network interfaces on a routing device must connect to different networks with distinct IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.10.n and 192.168.11.n). Thus, adding a firewall appliance that has multiple interfaces could potentially force a network to be subdivided into separate network addresses (because although a firewall appliance is not a router, it performs routing). Proxy ARP is the answer for administrators who do not want to renumber their network. It is a technique that the Firebox uses to handle traffic between hosts that don't expect to encounter a routing device -- those hosts would expect to transmit directly to hosts now placed behind a firewall. Using Proxy ARP, the Firebox responds to ARP requests for hosts on the \"other side\" of it that can't reply for themselves. The Firebox gives an ARP reply matching the remote IP address with the Firebox's own Ethernet address (in essence, a lie, so that the requesting half of the network can continue acting as if the other half of the network is local). The Firebox then receives packets on behalf of hosts behind it, and forwards them appropriately. Proxy ARP is what allows you to use the same network address across all three Ethernet interfaces of the Firebox, known as drop-in mode. \n See also Address Resolution Protocol.  \n  "}]}}}}}},"t":{"o":{"c":{"o":{"l":{"*":[{"word":"protocol","def":" A set of formal rules describing how to transmit data, especially across a network.
