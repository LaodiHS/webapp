Computer programs usually consist of modules of code. Each module consists of a small part of the program written to perform one specific task. These small, special-purpose chunks of code are called functions. When a program runs, it calls different functions to perform certain tasks. For example, a programmer could write a function to alphabetize a list of names. When the program got to the place where it needed to alphabetize a list of names, the program would call the alphabetizing function, and the function would return the list of names in the correct order. If those names then had to be inserted into a database, the program might call a different function to accomplish that. \n See also parameter and Dynamic Link Libraries.  \n  "}]}}}}}},"l":{"l":{"y":{" ":{"Q":{"u":{"a":{"l":{"i":{"f":{"i":{"e":{"d":{" ":{"D":{"o":{"m":{"a":{"i":{"n":{" ":{"N":{"a":{"m":{"e":{"*":[{"word":"Fully Qualified Domain Name","def":" See FQDN.  \n  "}]}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},"-":{"Q":{"u":{"a":{"l":{"i":{"f":{"i":{"e":{"d":{" ":{"D":{"o":{"m":{"a":{"i":{"n":{" ":{"N":{"a":{"m":{"e":{"*":[{"word":"Fully-Qualified Domain Name","def":"Fully-Qualified Domain Name \n A Fully-Qualified Domain Name is a server name with a hostname followed by the full domain name."}]}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}," ":{"D":{"u":{"p":{"l":{"e":{"x":{"*":[{"word":"Full Duplex","def":"Full Duplex \n A type of duplex communications channel which carries data in both directions at once.
