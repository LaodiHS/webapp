If it is new to you, please begin by reading the entry for IP address.  \n  A subnet mask is a numeric value that helps a networked host or router understand how to interpret the destination IP address on packets the machine receives. When a computer receives a data packet, it tries to figure out if the IP address the packet is destined for is local (meaning, on the same network segment as the machine), or non-local. This matters to the machine because if the destination is local, the machine can deliver the packet (using ARP). If the address is not local, the machine does not know how to deliver the packet. Figuratively, it says, \"I give up!\" and forwards the packet to the default gateway (another machine, often a router, which handles everything non-local).  \n  In trying to decide whether a destination IP address is local or not, the machine must discern how much of the IP address designates the destination network, and how much of the address designates the destination host. If the destination address is 192.168.14.10, what part of that address specifies the destination network? 192? Or 192.168? Or perhaps 192.168.14?  \n  The subnet mask, which is specified on each networked machine in a routing table, provides the answer. Like an IP address, a subnet mask is a 32-bit value. The machine combines it mathematically with the destination IP address, using an operation called a \"Boolean AND.\" The nature of the subnet mask plus the Boolean AND guarantee a result that will tell the machine, in binary values, how much of the IP address is the network range and how much is the host address. The machine then understands how to properly forward the packet. \n See also CIDR and slash notation.
