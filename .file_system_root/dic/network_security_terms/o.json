The reason for doing so is that potentially, a larger group of programmers will produce a more useful and bug-free product than a smaller group of programmers, and that more people will use software that is free. The concept relies on peer review to find and eliminate bugs in the program code, which happens at a much quicker rate than with commercial software because the information is shared throughout the open source community instead of through a corporation's smaller, proprietary R & D department. One of the most famous examples of open source software is Linux.  \n  "}]}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},"n":{"e":{"-":{"w":{"a":{"y":{" ":{"h":{"a":{"s":{"h":{" ":{"f":{"u":{"n":{"c":{"t":{"i":{"o":{"n":{"*":[{"word":"one-way hash function","def":" A mathematical process performed on data to produce a numeric result called a message digest, which cannot be reversed to produce the original message. \n See hash and message digest.  \n  "}]}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},"t":{"i":{"m":{"e":{" ":{"p":{"a":{"d":{"*":[{"word":"one-time pad","def":" A stack of papers bound together, with each paper providing one large, non-repeating set of truly random letters and/or numbers used as an encryption key.
