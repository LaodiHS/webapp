He was then banished with his wise uncle Iroh and would not be allowed home until he caught the Avatar ,  and thus return his honour.  \\r\\nIn season 2 Zuko and Iroh become fugitives. Whilst Iroh just wants to start a new peaceful life ,  Zuko still yoyos between good and bad. A new persona is borne of this inner conflict - the Blue Spirit.\\r\\nWhen it finally seems Zuko has changed for the better he throws it all away to return to the Fire Nation with his evil sister Azula and claim his throne once again. \\r\\nSeason 3 sees Zuko still struggling between good and evil. Although he now has his throne back ,  he feels guilt and anger because it was through his fault that his uncle was thrown in prison. He eventually confronts his evil father and says that he is leaving to help the Avatar learn firebending. Ozai shoots lightening at his son ,  but through a lesson Iroh had taught him Zuko was able to redirect it. He escapes and follows Team Avatar to the Western Air Temple ,  where he offers to help teach Aang. Despite being ultimately rejected and attacked after his first attempt ,  the team eventually allows him to join ,  mostly thanks to Toph's support of him. However Katara doesn't trust him at all and at the end of \"The Western Air Temple\" gives Zuko a serious warning not to step out of line ,  or she will make sure his destiny ends permanently.\\n> \"Hello ,  Zuko here.

The sword closely resembles the nodachi or odachi ,  however it differs from the nodachi by having a ricasso of approximately 12 to 18 inches (460 mm). This lends more to the theory of the sword having a practical use in feudal Japan. The increased length of the blade ,  along with the extra grip ,  would give it dual use both as a sword and as a polearm for attacking advancing cavalry. This style of zanbato sword can be found for sale in rural tourist shops and stands in Kyoto and Nara prefectures of Japan. This sword may have been inspired by the Chinese zhan ma dao as both were said to have been used for killing the horse and rider in one swing. It is likely that the zanbato is actually a mis-construction of the zhǎn mǎ dāo ,  poorly drawn or translated by Japanese travellers who witnessed the weapon being used during battle.\\n> Such extremely long and curved zabatao swords did exist ,  and were solely used for ceremonial purposes. Experienced smiths often took upon themselves to prove their talent by creating these so-called \"zanbato\" as a way to challenge themselves. This led to the extremely long blades often seen in ancient depictions ,  some of which were so long (over a dozen feet long) that they could hardly be mistaken for something other than display pieces.\\n\"","translation":"","pos":"","collins":"","oxford":"","tag":"","bnc":"0","frq":"0","exchange":"","detail":"","audio":""}]}}}}},"m":{"z":{"u":{"m":{"m":{"i":{"m":{"*":[{"word":"Zamzummim","phonetic":"zæm'zʌmim","definition":"","translation":"n.
