(preface, 



object of the two volumes which form the present 
work is to supply the student of Assyrian Demonology 
with English transliterations and translations, with the 
necessary notes, etc., of the documents printed in 
the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Parts of Cuneiform 
Texts from Babylonian Tablets, etc., which have 
been recently issued by the Trustees of the British 
Museum. An examination of these two Parts will 
show that they contain copies of all the Tablets 
belonging to the Series Utukki Limnuti, Asakki 
Marsuti, and Ti'i, i.e., " Evil Spirits," '' Fever 
Sickness," and '' Headache," which have now been 
identified, together with the texts of a considerable 
number of compositions of a similar character. 

These collections of Evil Spirit Texts form large and 
important sections of the native literature concerning 
Babylonian and Assyrian Demonology, and there is 
reason to believe that the material now published 
represents about one-half of that belonging to the 
three Series mentioned above which was known to 
the scribes of Assurbanipal. Of the condition of 
the archetypes in pre- Babylonian times we have no 
information whatever, but there is no reason to doubt 
that the versions which were adopted as standard 



XII PREFACE. 



texts In the reign of Assurbanipal represented sub- 
stantially the readings of the primitive documents. We 
are, In short, justified In assuming that we have In our 
hands at the present time tolerably accurate copies of 
the exorcisms and spells which the Sumerlan and his 
Babylonian successor employed, some six or seven 
thousand years ago, to avert the attacks of devils, and 
to ward off malign Influences of every kind. 

The first to make known to the world the character 
of the Evil Spirit Texts was the late General H. C. 
Rawllnson, Bart., G.C.B., who published In the 
Fourth Volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of 
Western Asia, London, 1875, ^.s much of the text 
of the Fifth and Sixteenth Tablets as had then been 
Identified. During the period of the preparation of 
the seventy plates which form the Fourth Volume 
printed copies of many of them were supplied to 
M. Francois Lenormant, and to various other scholars, 
and M. Lenormant Issued some months before the 
appearance of the British Museum publication his 
La Magic chez les Chaldeennes et les Origines 
AccadienneSy In which he gave renderings of several 
of the texts relating to Evil Spirits. In the year 
1887 Professor Sayce, In his Hibbert Lectures, 
gave English translations of the greater number of 
the texts with which M. Lenormant had already 
dealt, as well as of others. The translations, however, 
of both these scholars were necessarily Incomplete, for 
the simple reason that only a portion of the available 



PREFACE. XIII 



material had been published by the late Sir Henry 
Rawllnson, who made no pretence of publishing In 
his Immortal Corpus of cuneiform texts more than 
specimens of the various classes of literature which 
were known to the Babylonians and Assyrians. 
Subsequently several of the texts of this class have 
been studied and referred to in the publications of 
various Assyriologists, but the present work represents 
the first attempt which has been made to deal with 
any of the groups of the Evil Spirit Texts as a whole, 
and of course no connected translations of them have 
before appeared. 

In this and the following volume of Messrs. Luzac's 
*' Semitic Text and Translation Series " transliterations 
and translations of about two hundred and forty tablets 
and fragments belonging to various collections In the 
British Museum are given, and it is believed that 
about one hundred and sixty of these are published in 
Ctmez/brm Texts from Babylonian Tablets, etc., Parts 
XVI and XVII, for the first time. The present 
publication is Intended to do for the '' Evil Spirit " 
Series, and the Series relating to Fevers and Head- 
aches, what Professor Zimmern has done for the 
Shurpii Series, and Professor Tallqvlst for the Maklit 
Series. 

The reader's attention Is called to the fact that 
where It has been impossible to assign to Tablets 
their correct position In their Series, they have been 
indicated by the letters "A," " B," '' C," etc. In 



XIV PREFACE. 



translating the texts the renderings into English 
have been made as literal as possible, and wherever 
possible the Assyrian word has been translated by 
the same English equivalent. 

The material given in the following pages will 
be found to afford abundant proof of the fact that 
a considerable proportion of the magical practices 
which are in use in the East to the present day 
were well known to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia 
several thousands of years ago, and that many of them 
were borrowed by the Hebrews and other dwellers in 
Syria and Persia from their neighbours on the Tigris 
and Euphrates. 

As was to be expected, a number of misconceptions 
have arisen during the last few years as to the purport 
of certain magical texts, and as an example of this 
may be specially mentioned the views which have been 
promulgated concerning Tablet '' K," (11. 183 ff.), for 
it has been confidently asserted that this document 
contains an allusion to the Biblical Garden of Eden. 
The text of this tablet mentions a place called Eridu, 
and a plant or tree named kiskanu, of dense growth 
and shining appearance, which grew beside the abyss, 
i.e. the Ocean or Sea ; the place where the plant 
grew was said to be the couch of a god. Immediately 
following these statements is a reference to Shamash 
and Tammuz, who are said to dwell "in its interior," 
and mention is next made of the '' mouths of the 
rivers." Such are the statements of the tablet, but. 



PREFACE. XV 



I 



basing their opinion on certain interpretations of the 
above text, some Assyriologists have asserted that 
the Babylonian Garden of Eden was in the immediate 
vicinity of Eridu, and they have identified the tree or 
plant with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and 
Evil, which was believed to grow in the Hebrew 
Paradise. Quite recently, however, the missing portion 
of this text has been identified, and it is now clear that 
the text is an incantation and nothing more. This 
document, the opening lines of which have been so 
strangely misunderstood, indicated to the magician, 
who was about to treat his afflicted patient, that 
a certain kind of plant or tree, the original of which, 
according to tradition, grew in Eridu, and afforded 
a dwelling to Shamash and Tammuz, contained magical 
properties ; and acting on this information the magician 
was directed to make use of a portion of the kiskanu 
plant or tree on behalf of the said patient. The text 
actually states that the gods themselves made use of 
this plant to work a miracle of healing, and the 
implication is that as the kiskanu plant was on this 
occasion of great benefit, it may again be made to 
perform the healing of a sufferer, always provided 
that suitable Words of Power were recited by a duly 
qualified person, and appropriate ceremonies were per- 
formed, before the plant itself was used as a remedy. 
Thus there is no reason for believing that the text 
of Tablet *' K " contains any allusion to the Garden 
of Eden, or that the plant kiskanu is anything more 



XVI PREFACE. 



than a herb or shrub which was used in working 
magic. Further, the identification of the kiskanu 
plant with the '' vine " has nothing to rest upon, and 
still less does it in any way represent the Babylonian 
equivalent of the Tree of Life. '' The mouths of the 
rivers " have nothing to do with the four rivers of the 
Hebrew Paradise, and the new fragment leaves no 
room for doubt that the line in which they are 
mentioned merely explains the locality from which the 
gods obtained the plant, namely, from the confluence 
of two streams or rivers. 

To Mr. L. W. King I owe many thanks for his 
friendly help in this work, and especially his assistance 
in reading doubtful signs on the clay tablets. 

In conclusion, my thanks are due to Dr. E. A. 
Wallis Budge for much kind help, and for his numerous 
suggestions in such parts of the volume as deal with 
comparative magic.

3n^ifobttC^ion, 



3ntrobuction. 



From the earliest times Eastern races, in common 
with the rest of mankind, have always held a firm 
belief in the existence of evil spirits, ghosts, and all 
kindred powers. The phenomena of death, the 
mystery of disease and sickness, and all the other 
events of common occurrence in daily life gave rise to 
speculations about the unseen world, which gradually 
led to a distinction, although slight at all times, 
between good and evil spirits. The early Semitic 
people of Babylonia, whoever they may have been 
or wherever they may have migrated from, found 
a theology ready to their hands in their adopted 
country, which they took over from its primitive 
inhabitants the Sumerians, doubtless grafting to it 
many of the beliefs of their forefathers. To the latest 
times, down to a century or two before the Christian 
era, they retained the doctrines in their original 
language, making interlinear translations of them for 
use in the temples and among the doctors, and it is 
owing to this that we can speak with tolerable 
certainty on many points of the early religion of 
Babylonia. 

There is little comparatively that shows traces of 
original Semitic composition in the books and docu- 
ments relating to spirits, for by far the greater part 



XXII INTRODUCTION. 



of the enormous mass of material of this class is 
written in the Sumerian language, either with or 
without a Babylonian or Assyrian translation, and 
the numerous Sumerian words for the various forms 
of spirits and demons were either incorporated bodily 
in the newcomers' language, with, of course, the 
necessary phonetic changes, or were translated either 
exactly or paraphrastically. Indeed, it is a remarkable 
thing that that portion of the Semitic stock which 
entered Babylonia, although receptive on all points, 
! I seems to have been very limited in original ideas 
regarding the ghost world ; and this is not unnatural, 
since at that early period the Semite can hardly have 
been much more than a nomad possessing only the 
beginnings of a civilization. He recognized "gods" 
(singular, ILU ; plural, ilani ^) in common with the 
rest of his stock ; he seems to have had some idea 
that the soul or ekimmu, literally *' the thing which 
is snatched away," ^ possessed supernatural powers, 
or at least an existence ; but beyond this it is 
exceedingly difficult to say how much of his later 
psychology and eschatology was original, and how 
much was borrowed. This much seems certain. 



^ The original meaning of ILU, like the Hebrew /^5^ is of course 
unknown. The Sumerians indicated the word " god " by a star (^), 
and we are therefore justified in assuming that the Sumerians 
believed that their gods inhabited the sky. 

' The form ekimmu is distinctly against the view that it means 
"the snatcher," which would probably be ikkimu. 



DEMONS AMONG THE SEMITES XXIII 

however, that words Hke utukku ** spirit," alu 
''demon," lilu some form of ghost with feminine 
counterparts lilitu and ardat lili, and probably 
GALLU '' devil," were all borrowed from the Sumerians, 
and the names of two others, rabisu '' lurker " and 
AHHAZU *'seizer," are probably free renderings of 
Sumerian words for which the Babylonian had no 
exact equivalents. All these words occur in set 
phrases constantly in the incantations, and of the 
other names for spirits we find the following list : 

ILU, EKIMMU, SEDU, LABARTU, LABASU, and LAMASSU ; 

of these the first two have already been explained, but 
of the linguistic origin of the remainder very little is 
known. Indeed, among the other Semitic tribes, with 
the exception of the Arabs, the comparative paucity 
of words signifying demons is very marked, and most 
of the few which they employ are borrowed directly 
from Babylonia, the Hebrews using D^^tJ^ (i.e., sedu) 
and n^^^^ (i.e., lilitu), and in Rabbinic times pXK' 
and vf^s^ (i.e., lilu). nil, which is another word used 
by the Rabbis to mean ''spirit," is the ordinary word 
in Hebrew for this, and corresponds to ekimmu. 

It is therefore evident that when the Semitic 
Babylonian took over the learning of his Sumerian 
predecessors, he seems also to have unconsciously 
adapted and enlarged his ideas to fit their beliefs, 
receiving their doctrines in their entirety as worthy 
of implicit trust, and in the belief that his teachers 



XXIV INTRODUCTION. 



must necessarily understand the supernatural powers 
peculiar to their own country. 

(i) The various Classes of Evil Spirits. 

The primitive Sumerian recognized three distinct 
classes of evil spirit, all ready to torment the hapless 
wanderer.^ First came the disembodied human soul 
which could find no rest, and so wandered up and 
down the face of the earth ; secondly, the gruesome 
spirits which were half human and half demon ; and 
thirdly, the fiends and devils who were of the same 
nature as the gods, who rode on the noxious winds, 
or brought storms and pestilence. Each of these 
three kinds was divided up into classes according to 
the several characteristics of the evil spirits which 
composed them, and the six chief of these are 
enumerated in the constantly recurring line utukku 

LIMNU ALU LIMNU EKIMMU LIMNU GALLU LIMNU ILU 

LiMNU RABisu LIMNU, *' Evil Spirit, evil Demon, evil 
Ghost, evil Devil, evil God, evil Fiend," but this by 
no means includes all the powers of evil, for this list 
is frequently amplified by the additions labartu 

LABASU AHHAZU LILU LILITU ARDAT LILI, all vaHouS 

forms of malignant spirits. 

The first evil spirit, utukku, was originally a spirit, 
spectre, or ghost, since it is once at least used of the

infra^ p. xxviii. 



RAISING THE DEAD. XXV 

spectre of a dead man raised from the Underworld. J^ "^ '" 

This form of magic — necromancy — was a favourite ^y^f"' 

method employed for looking into the future in the East 

in ancient times, and a remarkable instance of it occurs 

in the Epic of Gilgamish. The story runs that the 

hero Gilgamish appeals to the god Nergal to restore 

his friend Ea-bani to him, and his prayer is answered, 

for the god opens the earth and the utukku of Ea-bani 

rises up " like the wind," that is, probably a transparent / 

spectre in the human shape of Ea-bani, who converses 

with Gilgamish.^ The same ideas and beliefs were 

current among the Hebrews, for when Saul goes to 

visit the ** woman with a familiar spirit " at En-dor 

she brings up Samuel out of the earth, and he answers 

the questions which Saul wishes to ask.^ Among 

the Assyrians "Raiser of the Departed Spirit"* was 

a recognized title of the sorcerer, and from this and 

the story in the Gilgamish Epic it is evident that such 

practices as necromancy were not uncommon. How 

far the utukku differed from the ekimmu (which is the 

proper word for a departed spirit) is difficult to say ; it 

was a ghost or spectre that either lurked in the desert 

lying in wait for man/ or it might have its home

in the mountains, sea, or graveyard,^ and evil would 
befall him on whom it merely cast its eye.^ 

The second of the six, the alu, is a demon that 
hides itself in dark corners and caverns in the rock, 
haunting ruins and deserted buildings and slinking 
through the streets at night like a pariah dog. It lies 
in wait for the unwary, ready to rush out from its 
hiding-place to '' envelop him as with a garment," 
or, coming into the bedchamber by night, it steals 
sleep away from weary mortals by standing over their 
beds and threatening to pounce upon them should they 
dare to close their eyes.^ It is a horrible apparition, 
at times without mouth, limbs, or ears, a half-human, 
half-devilish creation borne probably by the ghoulish 
LTLiTU or ARDAT LiLi to some man to whom she has 
attached herself.* This latter tradition remained current

XXVIII INTRODUCTION. 



cannot rest, and wanders as a spectre over the 
earth. After death, the souls of men and women 
who died in the ordinary course of nature entered 
into the Underworld, "the House of Darkness, the 
seat of the god Irkalla, the House from which none 
that enter come forth again," where they remained 
trying to eke out a wretched existence by feeding 
on dust and mud, and receiving the offerings and 
libations paid to them by their descendants and 
relations on earth. If for any reason these attentions 
should cease, and the spirit of the dead man be forgotten, 
then it was forced by hunger and thirst to come forth 
from its abode in Hades to seek on earth the food 
and water which no loijger filtered through to satisfy 
its wants, and, roaming up and down, it sought what 
it might devour. If it found a luckless man who had 
wandered far from his fellows into haunted places,^ 
it fastened upon him, plaguing and tormenting him 
until such time as a priest should drive it away with 
exorcisms. This is expressly stated on a tablet of 
this class which runs : — 

'' The gods which seize (upon man) 

H ave come forth from the grave ; 
*' The evil wind-gusts 

Have come forth from the grave ; 



^ This is the interpretation of the word muitaliku, " wanderer," 
which occurs so often in the magical texts to indicate the patient. 



ANCESTOR-WORSHIP. XXIX 



** To demand the payment of rites and the pouring 
out of libations, 

They have come forth from the grave ; 
'' All that is evil in their hosts, like a whirlwind 

Hath come forthTrom the grave." ^ 

Or again : — 

*' The evil Spirit, the evil Demon, the evil Ghost, 

the evil Devil, 
" From the earth have come forth ; 
*' From the Underworld unto the land they have 

come forth ; 
** In heaven they are unknown, 
" On earth they are not understood, 
*' They neither stand nor sit, 
" Nor eat nor drink." ^ . 

In making offerings to the dead lies the base of the 
principle of ancestor-worship ; the descendants give 
food and drink to the manes of their forefathers that 
they may not need to return to earth to demand from 
the living the care and attention that is their due. Even 
in the enlightened period of the later Assyrian empire, 
about B.C. 650, this belief was prevalent among the 



* Tablet *' Y," vol. ii. Among the ancient Egyptians, if offerings 
were not paid to the deceased, he was obliged to wander into un- 
clean places to eat such filth and drink such dirty water as he might 
find in the course of his wretched wanderings (Budge, Book of the 
Dead, chapters 52-53). 

2 Tablet *' CC," vol. ii. 



XXX INTRODUCTION. 



highest in the land, for we find Assurbanipal dese- 
crating the ancient tombs of the Kings of Elam and 
carrying away their bones and causing the rites paid 
to them to cease, so that their spirits might have no 
rest.^ In the Epic of Gilgamish, when the wraith of 
Ea-bani has been raised from the dead by Nergal, it 
describes the Underworld : — ^ 

** The man whose corpse lieth in the desert — 
" Thou and I have oft seen such an one — 

*' His spirit resteth not in the earth ; 

** The man whose spirit hath none to care for it — 
'' Thou and I have oft seen such an one — 

" The dregs of the vessel, the leavings of the feast, 

** And that which is cast out into the street are 
his food." 

But under certain circumstances the soul of a dead 
man never entered the Underworld, as is clear from 
the poem quoted above. The e^i7n?nu-spirit of an 
unburied corpse could find no rest and remained 
prowling about the earth so long as its body was 
above ground. In the Fourth Tablet of the Series 
*' Evil Spirits " various disembodied ghosts are 
exorcised and addressed individually : — ^ 

** Whether thou art a ghost unburied, 

'* Or a ghost that none careth for, 

'* Or a ghost with none to make offerings to it." 

' W.A.I., V, 6, 70 ff.

Tablet IV, col. v, 5. 



VARIOUS FORMS OF GHOSTS. XXXI 

'' Or a ghost that hath none to pour Hbations to it, 

" Or a ghost that hath no posterity." 

This last line shows that the duty of making 
oblations to the dead devolved, as was natural, on the 
eldest son and direct descendants, and this is one of 
the reasons for the overwhelming desire of the Semite 
for children to perpetuate the family name. There 
are other instances in which souls which cannot 
obtain rest are mentioned, e.g. : — 

'* He that lieth in a ditch .... 

"He that no grave covereth .... 

'' He that lieth uncovered, 

*' Whose head is uncovered with dust, 

'' The king's son that lieth in the desert, 

" Or in the ruins, 

" The hero whom they have slain with the sword." ^ 

But in addition to the ghosts of the unburied or 
uncared-for dead, the souls of men and women who 
died violent or unnatural deaths or who departed this 
life before fulfilling or completing certain duties could 
obtain no rest, and were compelled to remain as dis- 
embodied spirits to haunt mankind, until they were 
laid to rest by exorcism. Among these may be 
mentioned the following : — 

''He that hath died of hunger in prison, 

*' He that hath died of thirst in prison, 

' K. 156, col. ii, 1. 6 flf., W.A.L, ii, 17, and Haupt, Akkad, u, 
Sumer. Keilschr., p. 86. 



XXXII INTRODUCTION. 



*' The hungry man who in his hunger hath not 

smelt the smell of food, 
*' He whom the bank of a river hath made to perish, 
"He that hath died in the desert or marshes, 
** He that a storm hath overwhelmed in the desert, 
*' The Night-wraith that hath no husband, 
'' The Night-fiend ^ that hath no wife, 
"He that hath posterity ^ and he that hath none." ^ 

Many of these ghosts are merely elaborations of the 
preceding class, being the souls of those who were 
lost or forofotten. The " Nio^ht-wraith that hath no 
husband," who has the same characteristics as the 
Lilith of Rabbinic tradition, will be referred to again 
later on. The words "He that hath no posterity" 
of course refer to the man who has no descendants to 
pay him due rites. 

Other ghosts are the women who die in childbirth 
or while nursing their babes. The idea is that they 
will return in some form to seek their child.^ 



^ I very much doubt the existence of a "Night-fiend (literally 
Man of the Night Spirit) that hath no wife." The lilu, lilitu, 
and ARDAT LiLi (** Night-wraith, Woman of the Night Spirit ") 
occur constantly in the incantations, but I am not aware of any 
occurrence of idlu lili (" Man of the Night Spirit"), and it seems 
most probable that this line is only a scribe's parallel to the 
previous one, the text being entirely a grammatical composition for 
the use of students. "He that hath posterity" is quite similar: 
see p. xxxi.

THE LANGSUYAR. XXXIII 



This is a common form of ghost in Oriental 
countries. Doughty relates ^ how in Arabia he 
'' heard scotching owls sometimes in the night ; then 
" the nomad wives and children answered them with 
" mocking again, Ymgebds ! Ymgebas ! The hareem 
" said, It is a wailful woman, seeking her lost child 
'' through the wilderness, which was turned into this 
** forlorn bird." Among the Malays, if a woman dies 
in childbirth, she Is supposed to become a la^igsuyar 
or flying demon, a female familiar. To prevent this 
glass beads are put in the mouth of the corpse, a hen's 
^ZZ Is put under the armpits, and needles In the palms 
of the hands. This stops the dead woman shrieking, 
waving her arms, or opening her hands. ^ The 
original Langsuyar was supposed to be a kind of 
night owl,^ like the Llllth of Rabbinic tradition,* and 
is similar therefore to the ghost of which Doughty 
speaks. In India the ghost of a woman who dies in 
childbed Is a very terrible demon Indeed.^ 

The souls of the devoted temple-women who die 
of disease, and of men or maidens who have reached 
a marriageable age and yet die unmarried, are also 
included In the category of ghosts.^

XXXIV INTRODUCTION. 



If an ekimmu which could find no rest came back 
to earth he might fasten himself on anyone who had 
been in some way connected with him in this world. 
The chance sharing of food, oil, or clothes during life 
constituted an act which gave the spirit after death 
a claim to return to its friend or even casual ac- 
quaintance to demand the rites which would give it 
peace. Even the mere act of eating, drinking, or 
anointing or dressing oneself in company with another 
person without receiving or giving anything was 
enough. Such ghosts are denounced individually 
in three paragraphs of four lines each at the end of 
a long incantation where all possible kinds of 
spectres are exorcised : — 

" Whether thou be one with whom on a day I have 

eaten, 
** Or with whom on a day I have drunk, 
*' Or with whom on a day I have anointed myself, 
*' Or with whom on a day I have put on apparel." 
The other paragraphs are similar — '' Whether thou 
be one with whom I have entered and eaten," and 
*' whether thou be one with whom I have eaten food 
when I was hungry," and so on.^ Moreover, if a man 
only looked upon a corpse he rendered himself liable 
to be attacked by the departed spirit.^ 



^ Tablet IV, col. v, 1. 35 ff., and Tablet V, col. i, 1. 58.

the ghost, see Zimmern, Ritualtafeln^ p. 164. 



THE GALLU. XXXV 



The belief in the EKiMMU-spirit had obtained such 
a hold over the Assyrians, that they even went the 
length of deducing omens from the appearance of such 
a ghost in a house. As a rule it was held to be an 
evil omen, whether it was merely a silent apparition 
or whether it gibbered or uttered some words and 
awaited some response ; it foretold certainly the 
destruction of the house, and in the latter case the 
owner of the house would die in addition. The same 
omen-text^ bears witness to the prevalence of the 
universal belief in apparitions which come during 
the night to the bedside where the man lies, and 
describes their actions over or under the bed. 

The threat that is held over the heads of all 
spectres of this class is that no rites shall be paid to 
them until they have departed. Whether they are to 
be rewarded with their due after they have left the 
possessed man is not stated. 

The fourth spirit is the gallu, a devil which perhaps 
sometimes assumes the form of a bull, since it is once 
described as '' \\\^ gallu, the headstrong bull, the great 
ghost." ^ Like the alu it prowls about the streets of 
the city, and apparently it is neither male nor female ; ' 
in fact, it is sexless. The word is used in classical 
Assyrian as a term of abuse, for we find Sennacherib 
describing the hostile Babylonians as gallit limnicti, 
'' evil devils." ^

XXXVI INTRODUCTION. 



The fifth supernatural being is ilu limnu, or **evil 
god," presumably a more general term, for it is left 
indefinite, and there are few, if any, descriptions of it 
like the other spirits. 

The sixth spirit, the rabisu, as its name implies, 
is a lurking demon which, as the text quoted above 
shows, ^ sets the hair of the body on end, but little is 
known of its other characteristics. 

Of the three next, the labartu, labasu, and ahhazu, 
the labartu has a whole series of texts written against 
her. It is a female demon, the daughter of Anu, the 
trusted and accepted of Irnina, and she makes her 
home in the mountains, or cane-brakes of the marshes. 
Especially were children exposed to her attacks, and in 
the Series called by her name, which gives directions 
for driving her away, there are special ceremonies to 
be performed in connection with certain mystic words 
which are to be written on a stone and hung round 
the neck of a child.^ 

The Ahhazu or ** Seizer " was a demon of some 
kind, but we know nothing of its attributes, and the 
same may be said of the labasu, which is here 
translated '' ghoul " ; the meaning, however, is quite 
uncertain. 

Another triad of demons bore the interesting names 
of LiLU, LiLiTU, and ardat lili. The second is 



^ p. xxvii. 



Myhrman, Z.A., xvi, p. 147. 



LILTTH. XXXVII 



obviously the feminine counterpart of the first, but it is 
difficult to discriminate between lilitu and the third, 
ARDAT LiLi. LiLiTU is Undoubtedly the word from 
which the Hebrew Lilith was borrowed, which occurs 
in Isaiah, xxxiv, 14, " The wild beasts of the desert 
shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, 
and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl 

(n^^^^) also shall rest there, and find for herself a place 
of rest." The Rabbinic literature also is full of legends 
of her doing's. According to tradition she bore to 
Adam devils, spirits, and lilin (i.e. the same word as 
the Assyrian lilu).^ But although there is no doubt 
that the lilitu was a night spirit, it is improbable 
that the Lilith should have any real connection with 
the Hebrew lailah, ''night." The Rabbis naturally 
assumed that there was such a connection, and on 
the face of it such a comparison was plausible ; but 
the evidence of the Assyrian word lilu shows that 
we can no longer accept what would otherwise be 
a reasonable derivation. If we are to find a Semitic 
derivation for it at all, and if it has not been taken 
over from the Sumerian, which seems most probable, 
it may be connected with lalu, ''to be abundant," 
lalu, " luxuriousness " and htlu, " lasciviousness, 



wantonness."^ 



The ARDAT LILI differs from the lilitu in that her

"^ This is the view held by Martin, Texies Religieux, p. 25. 



L 



XXXVIII INTRODUCTION. 



relations with human beings are much closer, and 
she thus takes over the functions of the Hebrew 
Lilith. The word ardatu, as has been explained 
above, always implies a marriageable woman, and 
this use bears further testimony to this. In one of 
the magical texts the sick man is described as one 
whom the ardat lili has wedded.^ In the explana- 
tory text K. 156,^ mention is made of the ardat lili 
'' that has no husband," a restless ghost that wanders 
up and down, forced by her desire to roam abroad, 
unable to rest quietly until she is satisfied. She 
therefore appears to have been the spirit of a woman, 
such as that which came to tempt St. Antony, and it 
is probably she who gives birth to the alu or devil 
half-human, half-spectre, while the lilitu, although 
the female counterpart of the lilu, was less human in 
its characteristics. 

These were the principal spirits, but they formed 
only a single class of the powers of evil which might 
attack man. Witchcraft, sorcery, the Evil Eye, which 
cast a baneful glance, the Evil Tongue, which let 
fall a minatory word, and the evil man, were all foes 
which the exorcist had to meet. The Evil Eye is 
a very real terror to the Oriental, and it is even 
personified as a demon in a Syriac charm: — ''The 
Evil Eye went forth from the stone of the rock. 



' See p. xxvii. 
^ See p. xxxii. 



THE EVIL EYE. XXXIX

and the angel Gabriel met her." ^ There is a similar 
text in Assyrian about it : — 

** It hath looked on the traveller, 
** And like wood cut for poles 
"It hath bent his neck. 
*' Ea hath seen this man and 
" Hath placed food at his head, 
'* Hath brought food for his body, 
'' Hath shown favour for his life."^ 

The *'evil man " may possibly have an echo in the 
old Rabbinic tradition, that the souls of the wicked 
when they die are the devils which are in this world.^ 

The Underworld Ekurra, the dwelling of the god 
Bel, was the abode of demons, whence they went forth to 
seize upon men.* This was a tradition which descended 
to the Arabs concerning the Jinn, of which half are 
malignant and half good demons, and they inhabit the 
seven stages which form the edifice of the Under- 
world : ^ in passing it is worth noting that the Arabic 
for a madman is majnun, or one possessed by Jinn. 
The Babylonian devils also dwelt in Eridu as the 
servants of Ea and Damkina, ready to pounce on 
the hapless ''wanderer."^ The lonely mountains, too.

were the home of many spectres, and from a recently 
identified text we learn that : — 

" Headache hath come forth from the Underworld, 

"It hath come forth from the Dwelling of Bel, 

" From amid the mountains it hath descended upon 

the land, 
*' From the ends of the mountains it hath descended 

upon the land, 
*' From the fields not to return it hath descended, 
''With the mountain - goat unto the fold it hath 

descended, 
*' With the ibex unto the Open-horned flocks it hath 

descended, 
** With the Open-horned unto the Big-horned it 

hath descended." ^ 

There is certainly an echo of this in the Syriac 
magic lore, in one of the charms against lunacy which 
ends : — . . . '* [O Evil Spirit of Lunacy,] you 
*' will needs go forth from the bones, from the sinews, 
*' from the flesh, from the skin, and from the hair unto 
** the ground, and from the ground (passing) to iron, 
'' and from iron to stone, and from stone (you will 
** pass on) to the mountain. This writing must be 
'* sealed. Amen ! Amen ! " ^ 

The deserts and ruins were also favourite haunts of

HAUNTED HOUSES. XLI 



ghosts and goblins.^ The ghoul of the Arabs dwells 
in the desert and appears to travellers in a friendly 
guise in order to make them lose their way,^ and in 
the same way in the Assyrian belief it is the traveller 
who is most liable to attacks. 

The occupation of ruins by spectres is a universal 
superstition, and one to be explained by the belief that 
the spirit prefers a house if it can obtain it, and that 
it selects a deserted habitation because there are no 
longer in it any amulets or charms, or tutelary gods 
to keep it out. An inhabited house they may attack 
and force a way in temporarily, but on their presence 
there becoming known, the owner will at once take 
steps to render it untenable by them and drive them 
forth with the help of the exorcist. For this reason 
also the desert and inaccessible mountains, as affording 
dwellings far remote from mankind, were assigned 
as the probable locality for all malignant powers. 
A Syriac story of the ninth century testifies to this 
belief concerning ruins, for we read : " And while 
" a certain man was passing at night along the road 
'' by the side of a fire temple of the Magians which 
'' had been a ruin for some time, devils sprang out 
" upon him in the form of black ravens, and they 
'' entered into him and convulsed him."^ In an

XLII INTRODUCTION. 



Ethiopic magical prayer written for 'Ahita Mikael the 
same belief appears, for It prescribes certain glorious 
names, probably to be recited, ''at the front and at the 
" doors If thou wouldst enter into a house which Is old 
*' or In ruins or unclean." ^ 

In the New Testament the Saviour goes Into the 
wilderness and there meets the devil. ^ 

(2) The Seven Evil Spirits. 

There are certain spirits described as " the Seven " 
around whom a great many poems were composed 
and welded Into the incantations and spells. The 
best known is the Invocation against the Seven : — 

" Seven are they ! Seven are they ! 

"In the Ocean Deep seven are they ! 

" Battening in Heaven seven are they, 

*' Bred In the depths of Ocean. 

** Nor male nor female are they, 

"But are as the roaming windblast, 

" No wife have they, no son can they beget ; 

" Knowing neither mercy nor pity, 

" They hearken not to prayer or supplication. 

" They are as horses reared among the hills . . 

" Of these seven [the first] is the South Wind . 
" The second Is a dragon with mouth agape 
" That none can [withstand] ;

'' The third is a grim leopard

These Seven Spirits constantly reappear in various 
shapes and forms in the legends of other Semitic 
nations. The old Palestinian tradition of the Unclean 
Spirit undoubtedly owes something of its origin to 
them : — *' The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of 
" the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking 
'' rest ; and finding none, he saith, I will turn back 



' Tablet XVI, 1. 13. 



XLIV INTRODUCTION. 



" unto my house whence I came out. And when he 
'' is come, he findeth it swept and garnished. Then 
" goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more 
'' evil than himself . . ."^ But a still more striking 
evidence of the conservatism of Eastern tradition is 
shown in a Syriac charm which is worth quoting in full. 

'' [For] the fold of catde. 

** * Seven accursed brothers, accursed sons ! de- 
' structive ones, sons of men of destruction ! Why 
' do you creep along on your knees and move upon 
' your hands ? ' And they replied, ' We go on our 
* hands, so that we may eat flesh, and we crawl along 
'upon our hands, so that we may drink blood.' As 
soon as I saw it, I prevented them from devouring, 
and I cursed and bound them in the name of the 
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, saying, ' May 
'you not proceed on your way, nor finish your 
'journey, and may God break your teeth, and cut 
' the veins of your neck, and the sinews thereof, that 
'you approach not the sheep nor the oxen of the 
' person who carries [sc. these writs] ! I bind you 
' in the name of Gabriel and Michael. I bind you 
'by that angel who judged the woman that combed 
'(the hair of) her head on the eve of Holy Sunday. 
' May they vanish as smoke from before the wind 
' for ever and ever, Amen ! ' " ^

THE SEVEN SPIRITS. XLV 

As will be seen from the following excerpts from 
the Assyrian poems, the Seven Spirits altered but little 
as time went on : — 

" They creep like a snake on their bellies, 
** They make the chamber to stink like mice, 
*' They give tongue like a pack of hounds." ^ 

** Over the highest wall and through the thickest 

wall, 
** Like a stormflood they can pass, . 
*' Breaking through from house to house ; 
" No door can shut them out, 
" No bolt can turn them back, 
" For through the portal like a snake they creep, 
'' And through the hinges like the wind they blow." ^ 

It is they who rush over a city on the storm clouds, 
bringing devastation in their train, and from them 
come all hurricanes and tempests. They unsettle 
everyone that they may meet, bringing unrest, disorder, 
and confusion into the world, and to them is due the 
restlessness and desire for wandering which come 
upon men. 

'* They scour from land to land, 

" Driving the maid from her chamber, 

" And the man from his home, 

** And the son from his father s house.

'' They hunt the doves from their cotes, 

*' And drive the bird from Its nest, 

" And chase the martin from Its hole." ^ 

The Syrlac belief described above In their assailing

not a late development.

URA, THE PLAGUE-GOD.

The power of spreading particular diseases was 
attributed to certain demons such as Ura, the plague- 
spirit, and Ashakku, the fever - spirit. There is a 
legend about Ura, the plague-spirit, which gives the 
vainglorious speech he made to Ishum : — 

* Ura was angry, and determined 
' To ravage the whole world, 
' But Ishum, his counsellor, appeased him 
' That he abandoned [his wrath] .... 
' And thus spake the hero Ura : — 
' ' Whosoever shall praise this song, 
' * In his shrine may plenty abound .... 

* ' Whosoever shall magnify my name, 
' * May he rule the four quarters of the world ; 

* ' Whosoever shall proclaim the glory of my valour 
' ' Shall have none to oppose him ; 
' ' The singer who chants It shall not die in pestilence, 
' ' But unto king and noble his speech shall be well- 
pleasing ; 

' ' The scribe who learns it shall escape from the 
foe .... 

* * In the shrine of the peoples where he cries my 
name continually 

' ' His understanding will I increase. 

' * In the house where this tablet is set, 

' 'Tho' I, Ura, be angry or the Imlna-bi gods bring 

havoc, 
' * Yet the dagger of pestilence shall not approach it, 
' ' Immunity shall rest upon it.' " ^

(3) Charms and Magical Preparations. 

As auxiliaries to the spells which he chanted, the 
magician would use various substances, animal, 
vegetable, or mineral, which had a ceremonial im- 
portance and were probably endued with magical 
power. In many instances these are of the same 
nature as amulets, and it is often easy to see how 
they have acquired their potency. Of these the 
simplest was pure water, which was sprinkled over 
the possessed person at the conclusion of an incan- 
tation, and this had a double meaning, symbolizing 
as it did the cleansing of the man from the spell and 
the presence of the great god Ea, whose emanation 
always remained in water and whose aid was invoked 
by these means. In order to drive out a Headache 
Demon, Marduk, according to the legend, came to 
Ea for advice, and he was told to take water at the 
confluence of two streams and sprinkle it over the 
man, performing as he did so certain ceremonies.^ 

Meteoric iron or aerolites^ seem to have been used 
as charms or amulets, and this is quite as intelligible 
as the use of water, since from the nature of them 
both they are obtained from the habitations of the 
gods. But when we come to tamarisks, reeds, and 
other plants, or flour, or hair from beasts, it is not 
so easy to see why such materials should have been 



^ See p. Ix. 

"^ See note to p. 105. 



THE TAMARISK IN MAGIC. XLIX 

adopted for magical purposes. A branch of tamarisk 
or the date-spathe ^ were held aloft In the hand during 
the exorcism which was to repel the attacks of demons 
and lay them under a ban, and this shows that they 
were possessed of magical power. Here we can see 
an idea similar to that of the use of water in magic, 
for just as water contains the power of the god Ea, 
so will any piece of tamarisk contain the emanation 
of the tree-spirit which lives in the sacred tamarisk- 
shrub.^ This use of branches in magic shows that 
the early inhabitants of Babylonia were in no wise 
different from other nations in believing that trees 
were inhabited by spirits or gods, and it Is on this 
principle of giving a sentient or perhaps divine 
nature to inanimate objects that so many of the 
amulets can be explained. There is a curious con- 
firmation of this use of branches in Babylonian magic 
on a bowl from Niffer, in the centre of which is the 
figure of a man, rudely drawn, holding up a branch 
of some tree in his hand. The rest of the bowl is 
inscribed with a Hebrew incantation to be recited.^ 



^ See p. 23. 

2 Manna is obtained from the tamarisk, and it is very probable 
that while a branch of the tree itself was brandished aloft as 
a visible sign, its medicinal products were used internally to cure 
the patient. *' Manna is a laxative, and a suitable expectorant in 
febrile affections of the lungs " (Still6, Maisch, etc., The National 
Dispensatory^ p. 1019). 

2 Hilprecht, Explorations in Bible Lands, p. 447. The bowl is, of 
course, much later than these cuneiform texts. 



INTRODUCTION. 



Certain birds possessed supernatural powers, notably 
the raven and the hawk : — 

'' A raven, the bird that helpeth the gods, 

*' In my right hand I hold ; 

*' A hawk, to flutter in thine evil face, 

** In my left hand I thrust forward."^ 
Among the Semites the raven was always associated 
with the supernatural. It was one of the birds sent 
forth by Noah from the Ark. The Arabs consider 
it a bird of ill-omen which foretells death and disaster,^ 
and it is unlawful food according to the Moslem law.^ 
In the Syriac History of the Blessed Virgin Mary"^ 
a certain young man is possessed by devils, but they 
are driven forth by exorcism and take the form of 
ravens ; and in Tko^nas of Marga the same belief is 
testified to.^ 

One of the stories of Bar-Hebraeus relates how in 
a certain village " a troop of devils appeared in the 
'' form of men, and they said to the villagers, ' Behold, 
" *a camel hath strayed away from us : give us a man 
** ' that he may search for him.' And when they 
"■ brought out a man to them to look for the camel, 
" he saw ravens flying about, and he made his escape,

'* ' these are devils and not men ; furthermore, they 
" * have lost no camel.' " ^ 

Devils assailed Rabban-bar-'idta In the form of 
"black stinking ravens "which flew up and tried to 
force themselves into his cell to destroy him, but were 
driven back to the sorcerer who sent them, by reason 
of his night-long prayers.^ 

The hawk is another of the magic birds of the East. 
It was the emblem of Horus in Egypt,^ which at once 
shows in how great a respect it was held. In the 
Syriac stories of Alexander, Nectanebus sends a drug 
to Philip of Macedon by means of an enchanted hawk, 
and it showed him a dream.* 

On the other hand, the owl was a bird of ill-omen 
among the Assyrians, as it is among the more modern 
Semites. Dr. Budge informs me that in many villages 
in the Soudan this same view is held of the duma or 
owl. If an owl hooted over an Assyrian city it was 
supposed to be the work of the Seven Devils.^ The 
Arabs of the present day consider the owl to be the 
wraith of a woman seeking her child.^ In Syria *'an owl 
heard hooting by a sick man is an omen of his death. "^

LII INTRODUCTION. 



It is regarded by the Malagasy as a bird of ill-omen, 
and is called by them the '' spirit bird," for they think 
it to be an embodiment of spirits, and its hoot in the 
night is a presage of evil.^ All three birds were 
unclean to the Hebrews, according to the Levitical 
law.^ Aelian also bears witness to these traditions by 
saying that it is considered by men to be a bird that 
presages evil.^ 

Animals and their hair were largely used in cere- 
monies, and great stress was laid on the beasts being 
virgin. A young pig, a virgin kid, or its hair are 
frequently mentioned, and this condition of ceremonial 
cleanness was imposed on the use of such beasts even 
down to the Middle Ages. The "virgin kid" was 
largely used by the wizards of a few hundred years 
ago in making parchment to be inscribed with magical 
spells.* 

In order to prevent the entrance of demons into 
the house the Assyrians hung up various plants near 
the door. 

" The Fleabane(?) on the lintel of the door I have 
hung, 

" St. John's wort (?), caper (?), and wheatears on 
the latch I have hung, 

" With a halter as a roving ass thy body I restrain."^

TRADITION IN MAGIC. LIII 

This custom has survived among the Jews of the 
present day, who hang aloes or cacti from the arch 
of the doorway as amulets.^ 

Spittle had great power in Babylonian sorcery, 
particularly in bewitching men or casting spells upon 
them. In the Third Tablet of the series " Evil Spirits," 
the priest claims that Ea has added his spittle to his, 
and although what it refers to is not quite clear, it 
is evident that considerable importance is attached to 
it.^ Presumably the spittle took some part in the 
ceremonial, just as it was used in Palestine a few 
centuries later. In the New Testament it is said of 
Christ that He " spat on the ground, and made clay 
of the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind 
man with the clay." ^ 

(4) Traditional Forms of Exorcisms. 
The Sumerians were very fond of repeating in 
their magical prescriptions long traditional stories of 
the gods, their doings, and how they were the first 
to discover the beneficent properties of the charms 
which were in daily use. Such a story is found in 
the text which begins '* In Eridu groweth the dark 
kiskanu,'' which is worth giving in full here, because 
of certain interpretations which have been suggested 
for it : —

The explanation of this text which has hitherto 
found credence among certain Assyriologists is that 



THE GARDEN OF EDEN. LV 

it contains nothing less than a reference to the 
Garden of Eden as it was known to the Babylonians. 
This view was originated by Professor Sayce in his 
Hibbert Lechcres (1887, p. 237), who draws a com- 
parison between this and the Biblical descriptions, 
and this is still maintained by him and Mr. Pinches 
in their respective books, The Religions of Ancient 
Egypt and Babylonia (Giff or d Lectures, 1902, p. 385) 
and The Old Testament in the light of the Historical 
Records of Assyria and Babylonia {1902, p. 71). As 
it Is an important point to consider, it will be as well 
to examine the evidence in detail ; but first it must 
be remarked that since the last publication of this 
text considerable additions have been made to it, as 
has been mentioned in the preface. Mr. Pinches 
bases his translation on that of Professor Sayce's 
rendering in 1887 : — ^ 



^ Professor Sayce's latest translation {Gifford Lectures, 1902, 
p. 386) differs somewhat from that in the Hibbert Lectures : — 

" In Eridu a vine grew overshadowing ; in a holy place was 

it brought forth ; 
** its root was of bright lapis, set in the world beneath. 
" The path of Ea was in Eridu, teeming with fertility. 
** His seat (there) is the centre of the earth ; 
*' his couch is the bed of the primeval mother. 
*' Into the heart of its holy house, which spreads its shade like 

a forest, hath no man entered. 
" In its midst is Tammuz, 

*' between the mouths of the rivers on both sides." 
Professor Sayce considers that Hommel may be right in trans- 
lating kiskanu *' palm " instead of " vine." 



LVI IJSrTRODUCTION. 



** Incantation : ' (In) Eridu a dark vine grew, it was 

made in a glorious place, 
" * Its appearance (as) lapis-lazuli, planted beside 

the Abyss, 
'' ' Which is Ae's path, filling Eridu with fertility. 
" * Its seat is the (central) point of the earth, 
'' ' Its dwelling is the couch of Nammu. 
'' ' To the glorious house, which is like a forest, its 

shadow extends, 
" ' No man enters its midst. 
" ' In its interior is the Sun-god, and the peerless 

mother of Tammuz. 
'* ' Between the mouths of the rivers (which are) on 

both sides.' " 

*' Here the text breaks off, and where it again 
" becomes legible, the phrases are those of an ordinary 
" incantation, whose connecting link with the above 
" poetical lines is lost." Mr. Pinches draws the 
following conclusions from this text : — (a) That Eridu 
*' was, to the Babylonians, as a garden of Eden, 
'' wherein grew a glorious tree, to all appearance 
" a vine, for the adjective ' dark' may very reasonably 
'' be regarded as referring to its fruit. Strange must 
" have been its appearance, for it is described as 
'' resembling ' white lapis-lazuli,' that is, the beautiful 
*' stone of that kind mottled blue and white." (d) " The 
*' probability that it was conceived by the Babylonians 
*' as a garden is strengthened by the fact that the 
*' god Ae, and his path, i.e. the rivers, filled the place 



THE GARDEN OF EDEN. LVII 

'' with fertility, and it was, moreover, the abode of the 
'* river-god Nammu, whose streams, the Tigris and 
** Euphrates, flowed on both sides." (c) '* There, too, 
*' dwelt the Sun, making the garden fruitful with his 
'* ever-vivifying beams, whilst * the peerless mother 
" of Tammuz,' probably a name of Damkina, added, 
** by her fructifying showers, to the fertility that the 
'' two great rivers brought down from the mountains 
'' from which they flowed." (d) " To complete still 
*' further the parallel with the Biblical Eden, it was 
'' represented as a place to which access was forbidden, 
** for * no man entered its midst,' as in the case of the 
'* Garden of Eden after the fall." 

But I very much doubt whether the words In the 
text will bear the interpretation which has been put 
upon them, or that the points of similarity are sufficiently 
marked to justify the comparison. First, as to the 
meaning of kiskanu^ which is supposed to be the 
Tree of Life, and has been identified with the vine. 
The kiskanu is a plant or tree divided in the 
Assyrian syllabaries into three classes, ^ /^^^/ '* white," 
salmi "■ dark," and sdmi '' brown." Mr. Pinches, 
who translates sami ''grey or blue,"^ considers 
that these colours refer to the fruit of the tree, and 
brings forward in support of his theory that the vine 
is" the only plant growing in the country with these 



^ PT.^./., ii, 45,4, 11. 53ff. 

^ The exact meaning is uncertain. The word, however, is used 
as an epithet of gold (see Delitzsch, H. W.B.y sub voce). 



LViri INTRODUCTION. 



three colours of fruit, and that the kiskanu is mentioned 
in the bilingual lists among plants of the vine species. 
But the colours may refer equally well to the flowers 
of the tree or plant, and no inference can be drawn 
from its position on the tablet on which the word 
occurs, for it is separated from the eight species of 
vine by two words, one of which is is-si sal-mi (" black 
wood "). Indeed, if any inference at all is to be drawn 
from its connection on this tablet [W.A.I., ii, No. 4) 
it is distinctly improbable that kiskanu means a vine, 
since each of the eight species mentioned is marked 
in Sumerian with a special sign for " vine," and 
the Sumerian for kiskanu has no such specification 
attached. 

It is, however, unnecessary to imagine a mytho- 
logical meaning for kiskanu. The text in question is 
for a sick man, and the kiskanu is to afford the remedy 
for his disease. We have seen that it is a vegetable, 
plant or shrub, identified by the three colours white, 
and probably blue and brown, which grows thickly like 
a grove by the river-side near Eridu in Southern 
Babylonia, and it now remains to identify this shrub. 
Mr. H. H. W. Pearson, of the Royal Gardens at 
Kew, informs me that the description coincides with 
that of the Astragalus, of which there are many 
varieties. From the Astragalus gu7n7nifer^ is obtained 



^ "The source of Tragacanth had been known for centuries to 
be some of the spiny species of Astragalus growing in Asia 



THE GARDEN OF EDEN. LIX 

Tragacanth, which possesses emollient and demulcent 
properties, and it was used by the Greek physicians 
as far back as the fourth or fifth centuries, to allay 
cough and hoarseness and to promote expectoration.^ 
It is still to be obtained in the bazaars of Bagdad, 
whither it comes from Persia.^ It seems, therefore, 
very probable that the kiskanu is one of the varieties 
of astragalus from which Tragacanth is procured. 

Again, ajta apsi tarsu (1. 2) cannot mean ''planted 
beside the Abyss," but is more probably "stretcheth 
out unto the Ocean Deep," i.e., the water. The 
fourth line has been given a remarkable meaning by 
the totally unwarranted insertion which Professor Sayce 
was the first to make, of the word "(central)," the 
whole line thus running, " Its seat is the (central) point 
of the earth," or, in Professor Sayce's later translation, 
"His seat (there) is the centre of the earth." But 
the line is nothing more than " its seat is the earth," 
i.e., its roots go deep into the earth, and it has nothing 



" Minor." All the principal species from which Tragacanth is 
obtained are natives of the mountainous districts in the East ; 
Asia Minor, Armenia, Persia and Kurdistan, Syria, and Greece. 
The Astragalus gummifer is "a small shrub, about 2 feet in 
" height .... leaves very numerous, closely placed, spreading 
•* in all directions about \\ inch long, pinnate, the rachis very 
*' hard, stiff, smooth, yellow, terminating in a very sharp point, 
'■'■ and persistent for some years as a woody spine" (Bentley and 
Trimen, Medicinal Plants^ No. 73).

LX INTRODUCTION. 



whatever to do with the 6iJL(j)a\b<; yrj^, as Professor 
Sayce originally suggested {^Hibbert Lectures, p. 238). 
Further, there are no grounds for Mr. Pinches' trans- 
lation '' the peerless mother of Tammuz," In the line 
'' In Its midst are Shamash and Tammuz." 

Mr. Pinches' arguments may thus be met one by 
one : — 

(a) That Eridu was as a Garden of Eden there is 
absolutely no reason to believe. There Is no reference 
at all to any garden In the text, and the natural 
interpretation is the one to follow, namely, that the 
kiskanu grew wild. 

[b) The presence of a river does not presuppose 
the presence of a garden, as Mr. Pinches would have 
us believe. Besides, the rivers which are mentioned 
have nothing to do with the River with Four Heads 
of Genesis, but have a purely ceremonial meaning, 
of which the explanation is this. The gods plucked 
the plant near to where two streams ran into one 
another, this being always a place with a magical 
significance. For instance, the magician is elsewhere 
directed to *' take water at the confluence of two 
streams, and with this water perform a purifying 
incantation,"^ or, again, he Is to *' take an earthen 
vessel which hath come from a great kiln, and at the 
confluence of two streams to bale up (.^) water." ^

THE GARDEN OF EDEN. LXI 

Inasmuch as the locality is the same in all three 
instances, and the texts are all of the same class, it 
follows that if the first are the Rivers of Eden, so also 
must be the second and third, which is obviously- 
absurd. In the two last cases it is clear that a place 
attainable by mortals is intended, and so also is it in 
the Eridu text. The magician is intended to imitate 
the gods and pluck the kiskanu from an earthly spot 
in order to heal his patient therewith, just as the gods, 
whose example he follows, did in times long past. 

[c) The mention of the presence of the Sun-god and 
Tammuz '' in its midst " does not by any means imply 
the existence of a divine garden for their habitation. 
Three explanations of this line are possible, first, that 
it has an entirely mythological reference, in which case 
the gods mentioned are some form of tree-spirit. If 
this be the case, there is still no proof that the kiskanu 
was the Tree of Knowledge, since the belief in tree- 
spirits is general in early communities, and it would 
be straining the whole idea to narrow one ill-defined 
and vague instance down to such a very special case 
as the Biblical tree. Secondly, if the explanation be 
purely physical, and is merely the description of the 
ordinary characteristics of the plant wrapped up in 
theological language, implying that it thrives in the 
Sun, just as its path is that of Ea, that is, that it lives 
near water, still less can it be referred to the Tree 
in Genesis. Probably, however, the explanation is 
a twofold combination of the above, pointing to its 



LXII INTRODUCTION. 



divine connection by reason of its peculiar habitat and 
position. The case with all magical plants used as 
charms in these incantations is the same, that they 
should have some divine association and connection 
whence their power should emanate.^ 

[d) The last point, " that no man enters its midst," 
is the one point of similarity which this text bears 
with the Biblical Eden. It has been shown above 
that there is no mention whatever of a garden and 
no reason to suppose that any is referred to ; that 
the kiskaitu is certainly not a vine, being probably 
nothing more than a flowering and perhaps thorny 
shrub, and that its association with the gods is similar 
to other plants used in incantations, since it is merely 
intended to explain the origin of its power in magic. 
So that the last point mentioned above is the only 
remaining support for the Eden-theory. Now, it is 
obvious that the phrase cannot refer to Eridu, since 
this was a city of human habitation, and therefore it can 
only refer to the kiskanu, which ''grows like a forest" 
or "grove," as the text itself says, and herein lies the 
interpretation. Either by reason of its thick growth 
or from its thorny character, or both, it is difficult to 
force a passage through, and no man can push his 
way into the depths of its thickets except with extreme 
trouble. 

^ As parallels, compare the description of the ** Heart-plant" 
(Kiichler, Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Assyrischen Medtzin, p. 9) and 
the Legend of the Worm (quoted below). 



THE LEGEND OF THE WORM. LXIII 

In all this text there is no mention of any of the 
following characteristics of the Biblical Garden of 
Eden : the planting of a garden by a god, the existence 
of every tree therein, the tree of life, the tree of know- 
ledge of good and evil or its fruit, the four-headed 
river, the presence of the serpent, and the Cherubim 
and the flaming sword. 

The real explanation of the text is perfectly simple 
without straining after Biblical comparisons. The 
^is^anu-plsinty according to tradition, grew in Eridu 
when the gods were nearer to mankind than in after 
days, and it was they who originally plucked it for 
medicinal use from the place where it grew where two 
streams met, and performed with it certain ceremonies. 
Their actions stamped the prescription as Infallible, and 
sanctioned the repetition of the ceremonies in later 
days, so that any more modern magician or priest, in 
treating his patient, might have a divine model to 
imitate. This is all that Is meant, and there is 
absolutely no reference to any Garden of Eden. 

As another instance of the fondness of the Baby- 
lonians for going back to the most primitive periods 
for their models in such matters, I may cite the Legend 
of the Worm,^ which has been hitherto unknown : — 

" After Anu [had created the Heavens], 
'' The Heavens created [the Earth], 

^ Legend of the Worm, vol. ii. The text is published in Cun. 
Tex/s, part xvii, pi. 50. 



LXIV INTRODUCTION. 



The Earth created the Rivers, 

The Rivers created the Canals, 

The Canals created the Marshes, 

The Marshes created the Worm. 

Came the Worm and wept before Shamash, 

Before Ea came her tears : — 

* What wilt thou give me for my food, 

* What wilt thou give me to devour ? ' 
' I will give thee dried bones, 

* And scented . . . -wood.' 
' Nay, what these dried bones of thine to me, 
' And thy scented . . . -wood ? 
' Let me drink among the teeth, 
' And set me on the gums ; 

* That I may devour the blood of the teeth, 
' And of their gums destroy their strength 
' Then shall I hold the bolt of the door.' " ^ 

The incantation is really one which was written for 
people with toothache, which was believed to be due 
to the gnawing of small worms. By repeating the 
story of the creation and subsequent action of the 
original Worm, the magician shows that he clearly 
has knowledge of the name of his enemy and his 
methods, always a fundamental principle in magic, and 
he may then proceed with his instructions : 

'' So must thou say this : O Worm ! 

** May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist ! " 



^ Compare Ecclesiastes, xii, 4. 



CONCLUSION. LXV 



and after chanting the incantation three times, he 
must rub a mixture of beer, a certain plant probably 
of a pungent nature, and oil on the tooth of his patient. 
From the facts stated in the above pages, the reader 
will be able to glean an idea of the scope and contents 
of one group of Sumerian magical texts, and it is 
hoped that the information therein given will induce 
the student of comparative folklore to investigate this 
important subject. It will, of course, be understood 
that the exact meanings of certain words are still 
obscure, but with the publication of new texts and 
further study, there is every reason for believing that 
we may shortly attain to a tolerably accurate know- 
ledge of the ceremonies, enchantments, and spells 
which the Sumerian sorcerer employed in dealing with 
credulous clients some six thousand years ago.

* Gullutia. From W.A.I., iv, 26 (4), 46, tam-tum si-i gal-ta-at 
(" the sea heaves "), galdtu has evidently the meaning of 
** quaking" (whence its more common meaning of "quaking 
with fear"), but here the translation "when I have shaken the 
sick man" is unlikely. It is more probable that just as the 
magician reduces the strength of the sick man (cf. the following 
line), and thereby that of the devil in him, so will he frighten into 
subjection the evil power which has possessed the body of the patient. 

^ Restore the first characters, sur-as, and compare pi. 31, 1. 102, 
which should read sur-as-sub a-ha-an-tum u-Su-us-sub, etc. 
In Devils and Evil Spirits, vol. ii, Tablet " O," II. 11-12, 
SUR-Ab-SUB is translated ti--u 'su-ru-uh-hu-\u~\. The meaning of 
a-ha-an-tum is doubtful; a-ha-an = «///z2 (Briinnow, List 
No. 11,704). u-su-suB is probably to be translated harbasu\ see 
pi. 46, 11. 168-169, where har-ba-su is certainly to be restored as the 
translation of u-su-[sub].

* The mutilated condition of this and the following line prevents

is doubtful, although justified as a translation of dingir-surim by 
Briinnow, No. 10,252. Lahra is supposed to be the Hebrew rdhel'y 
a ewe (Muss-Arnolt, Dictionary, p. 479), and there seems to be 
a parallel in the Arabic root raghala, suxit matrevi ; iv, lactavit ; 
grana in spicis producere coeperunt safa ; cf. also raghlun

From the description of it given here (" the potent eru of heaven,

probable that it signifies a meteorite or meteoric iron.

Incantation : — 

A clean reed, a long reed, 

A reed from an undefiled brake, 

A clean vessel of the gods, 

A stalk of flax * encircled with a glory. 

300. I am the messenger of Marduk, 
As I perform the pure incantation, 

305. I put bitumen on the door^ beneath, 

(Plate XXIIL) 

That Ea may rest within the house. 
May a kindly Spirit, a kindly Guardian, 
Enter the house. 
May no evil Spirit or evil Demon, 



(Brockelmann, Lexicon^ p. 163, a), ''arch," so that "Arch of the 
Gis-SA-KA-NA " clearly points to the meaning ** door" for the latter 
word (i.e., the actual door as the Sumerian "wood : middle: door'* 
shows, and not merely the whole doorway, gateposts and all). 
This is still further borne out by the present passage " I put 
bitumen on the door beneath," in order that Ea (the god of the 
water supposed to be spilt on the floor) may remain within the 
house, and not drain awav over the threshold into the street.

part xvii, pi. 26, Tablet " P," the only difference being in the line 
which Marduk speaks to his father, which is the first line of 
the tablet. Similarly, in the sixth tablet of the series Shurpii 
{W.A.I., iv, 7, i, 16-32), where the lines are also written out, 
Marduk quotes the first line of the tablet. Unfortunately, here it 
cannot be supplied.

* The ending of the reverse of Tablet " H " is the same as that 
of the Fifth Tablet, p. 80, but unless the text of the obverse fills 
the hiatus of 11. 47-55,, which does not, as far as can be judged at 
present, seem probable, Tablet '' H " must be regarded as part of 
a separate Tablet. 

^ This line and the similar lines in Tablet ** C " (156 and 173) 
have been translated thus in preference to ''The evil Spirit (is) 
the Fever of the desert," for the reason that the verb talput in 
Tablet *'C," I. 174, is in the second person.

» Kiskanu. From the description of the kiskanu salmu in these 
lines it may be inferred that it grew wild (it "springeth forth in 
a place undefiled "), it was of thick or dense growth (" bountiful in 
luxuriance," *' like a forest grove"), its locality was the river bank 
("where earth is, there is its place, and the Couch of the Goddess Id 
(the River Goddess) its home"). It occurs in the grammatical lists

Exorcism, incantation. 

Incantation : — 

In Eridu groweth the dark kiskanu * r/ ' 

That springeth forth in a place undefiled, 
185. Whereof the brilliance is shining lapis 
Which reacheth unto Ocean ; 
From Ea its way in Eridu 
Is bountiful in luxuriance, 

{W.A.L, ii, 45, 4, 1. 52 ff.), where three kinds are mentioned, //^m 
(" white "), salmi {'' dark "), and sdmt ('* brown " ?), and a few lines 
below several kinds of vine are explained. The determinative in 
Sumerian is Gis, " wood," and not u, " plant," or sar (postpositive), 
and it does not occur in the plant lists still extant (see Cun. 
Texts, part xiv), or in the list of vegetables, etc., in Merodach 
Baladan's Garden (ibid., pi. 50) ; and since three varieties are 
known (white, blue (.?), and brown), kiskanu must therefore be the 
name of several species of tree or shrub bearing different coloured 
flowers, berries, or fruit. From the first line of this incantation we 
know that it grew in Eridu (i.e. Southern Babylonia). Everything 
points to its being a real shrub or tree and not a mythical one, and 
Mr. H. H. W. Pearson, of the Royal Gardens at Kew, has kindly 
suggested to me that the astfagalus, of which there are more than 
thirty varieties (v. also Mr. Pearson's article on Palestinian Flora in 
Encyclopaedia Biblica, under Palestine), agrees with the description 
given above. On the possibility of its being one of the tragacanth- 
bearing varieties, and the various explanations of this text, see 
Introduction.
