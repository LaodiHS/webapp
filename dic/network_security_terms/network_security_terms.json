Its purpose is to guide product implementers so that their products will consistently work with other products. The reference model defines seven layers of functions that take place at each end of a communication. Although OSI is not always strictly adhered to in terms of keeping related functions together in a well-defined layer, many if not most products involved in telecommunication make an attempt to describe themselves in relation to the OSI model. It is also valuable as a single reference view of communication that furnishes everyone a common ground for education and discussion."

            "word": "OSI layers",
            "def": "OSI layers \n The main idea in OSI is that the process of communication between two end points in a telecommunication network can be divided into layers, with each layer adding its own set of special, related functions. Each communicating user or program is at a computer equipped with these seven layers of function. So, in a given message between users, there will be a flow of data through each layer at one end down through the layers in that computer and, at the other end, when the message arrives, another flow of data up through the layers in the receiving computer and ultimately to the end user or program. The actual programming and hardware that furnishes these seven layers of function is usually a combination of the computer operating system, applications (such as your Web browser), TCP/IP or alternative transport and network protocols, and the software and hardware that enable you to put a signal on one of the lines attached to your computer. OSI divides telecommunication into seven layers. The layers are in two groups. The upper four layers are used whenever a message passes from or to a user. The lower three layers (up to the network layer) are used when any message passes through the host computer or router. Messages intended for this computer pass to the upper layers. Messages destined for some other host are not passed up to the upper layers but are forwarded to another host. The seven layers are: Layer 7: The application layer...This is the layer at which communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. (This layer is not the application itself, although some applications may perform application layer functions.) Layer 6: The presentation layer...This is a layer, usually part of an operating system, that converts incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from a text stream into a popup window with the newly arrived text). Sometimes called the syntax layer. Layer 5: The session layer...This layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogs between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination. Layer 4: The transport layer...This layer manages the end-to-end control (for example, determining whether all packets have arrived) and error-checking. It ensures complete data transfer. Layer 3: The network layer...This layer handles the routing of the data (sending it in the right direction to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). The network layer does routing and forwarding. Layer 2: The data-link layer...This layer provides synchronization for the physical level and does bit-stuffing for strings of 1's in excess of 5. It furnishes transmission protocol knowledge and management. Layer 1: The physical layer...This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier."

Why would an attacker corrupt your DNS server's cache? So that your DNS server will give out incorrect answers that provide IP addresses of the attacker's choice, instead of the real addresses. Imagine that someone decides to use the Microsoft Update Web site to get the latest Internet Explorer patch. But, the attacker has inserted phony addresses for update.microsoft.com in your DNS server, so instead of being taken to Microsoft's download site, the victim's browser arrives at the attacker's site and downloads the latest worm.  \n  "

The devices on the network rely on the address in order to know where to route data.  \n  The format of an IP address is a 32-bit number divided into four 8-bit segments, separated by periods. The four segments, called octets, can be represented in binary notation (ones and zeros, the basic building blocks of all software) like this: 11010000.10001100.00100011.00000010. Because writing so many ones and zeros is inefficient and laborious for humans, IP addresses are usually converted to decimal notation when written out (but remember, the machines always understand them as ones and zeros). For example, the same binary address above, expressed in decimal, is 208.140.35.2. In decimal notation, no octet can have a value greater than 255. This is because binary requires 9 ones and zeros to express a number greater than 255, and the rules for IP addresses only allow 8.  \n  Some portion of any IP address designates a network, and the remaining portion of the address designates a specific device on that network.

If it is new to you, please begin by reading the entry for IP address.  \n  A subnet mask is a numeric value that helps a networked host or router understand how to interpret the destination IP address on packets the machine receives. When a computer receives a data packet, it tries to figure out if the IP address the packet is destined for is local (meaning, on the same network segment as the machine), or non-local. This matters to the machine because if the destination is local, the machine can deliver the packet (using ARP). If the address is not local, the machine does not know how to deliver the packet. Figuratively, it says, \"I give up!\" and forwards the packet to the default gateway (another machine, often a router, which handles everything non-local).  \n  In trying to decide whether a destination IP address is local or not, the machine must discern how much of the IP address designates the destination network, and how much of the address designates the destination host. If the destination address is 192.168.14.10, what part of that address specifies the destination network? 192? Or 192.168? Or perhaps 192.168.14?  \n  The subnet mask, which is specified on each networked machine in a routing table, provides the answer. Like an IP address, a subnet mask is a 32-bit value. The machine combines it mathematically with the destination IP address, using an operation called a \"Boolean AND.\" The nature of the subnet mask plus the Boolean AND guarantee a result that will tell the machine, in binary values, how much of the IP address is the network range and how much is the host address. The machine then understands how to properly forward the packet. \n See also CIDR and slash notation.
